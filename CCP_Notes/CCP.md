# AWS Cloud practitioner
### AWS Cloud Fundamentals
-   Server - is composed of cpu (compute) and ram (memory)
-   Router – a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. they know where to send your packets on the internet.
-   Switch – takes a packet and sends it to the correct server / client on your network
- Computer -> router -> switch -> some other network of computers
-	Problems with traditional IT approach (data centers)
-	You have to pay for the rent of the data center
-	You have to pay for the power supply, cooling and maintenance
-	Adding and replacing hardware takes time
-	Scaling is limited – it takes time and a lot of resources
-	Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
-	Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, apps, and other IT resources
-	Pay as you go pricing
-	Custom provisioning of power, size, type and resources
-	Instant access to practically unlimited resources
-	Simple access to servers, storage, databases, and set of apps
-	AWS owns and maintains the network connected hardware
-	Examples of some cloud services
-	Gmail, dropbox(used to be built on aws), Netflix (built entirely on AWS)

### The Deployment Models of the Cloud
-	Private cloud: cloud services used by a single org, not exposed to the public, you have complete control, security for sensitive apps, meet specific business needs.
-	Public cloud: Azure, Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services
-	Owned and operated by a 3rd party cloud service provider, delivered over the internet
-	Six advantages of cloud computing
-	Hybrid Cloud: Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud. Control over sensitive assets. Flexibility and cost effectiveness of a public cloud.
